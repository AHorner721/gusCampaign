          Richland is in need of a new direction to provide greater
          opportunities and living experiences for our citizens. My campaign
          focuses on economic development, job creation, and programs for our
          youth. It is my hope that an addressing these priorities will lead to
          a safer and improved Richland. Make a difference in our city and vote
          for me. I look forward to serving our city as your
          Mayor.
        </p>

        <p class="statementP1 left-align">
          Growing our city is going to take leadership. I am a proven leader
          having lead more than 100,000 Marines. I know what it takes to be a
          leader. Leadership starts from the top.
        </p>

        <p class="left-align">
          Richland, if you elect me as your Mayor, I will dedicate myself to
          serve in the best interest of our city. I love Richland, and I love
          our country. May God bless you, our city, and our country.
